# Agent Insights: Transparent Reviews, Trusted Choices
We are developing a web/ social app to assist clients to choose their best possible real estate agent.

## Problem Statement
How might potential home purchasers or sellers in Washington State achieve finding a trusted real estate advisor 
so that they can confidently make a desirable home purchase?

## Problem Background
### Context
According to the National Association of Realtors, there were 4,090,000 existing home sales in 2023. 88% of buyers purchased their homes through a Realtor or broker. 90% of sellers were assisted by a Realtor in the sale of their home. Finding a trusted real estate agent is an important problem for potential home purchasers. When making a large purchase such as a real estate, the complexity of the real estate purchase process causes a lot of potential home purchasers to lost an extensively amount of their savings.

### Current Need
There’s a lack of transparent, reliable platforms that provide verified insights into an agent's history, expertise, and client satisfaction, leaving consumers to rely on guesswork or biased recommendations.

### Potential Impact
If homebuyers and sellers don’t have a trusted advisor, they might feel overwhelmed and uncertain about one of the most important financial decisions of their lives. They could end up overpaying, underselling, or losing out on the perfect home. Without transparency or reliable guidance, they’re left to navigate a competitive market blindfolded, which can cause frustration, regret, and a lot of stress. Making no effort to solve this issue means people may miss out on achieving their dream home or investment goals.
